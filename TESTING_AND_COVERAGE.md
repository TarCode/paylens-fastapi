# 🧪 Testing and Coverage Setup

This document explains how to set up comprehensive test reporting and code coverage for your GitHub repository.

## 📊 Features

Your test pipeline will provide:

1. **📈 Codecov Integration** - Beautiful coverage reports and trends
2. **💬 PR Coverage Comments** - Automatic coverage comments on pull requests
3. **📋 Test Result Reports** - Detailed test summaries in GitHub Actions
4. **📁 Downloadable Artifacts** - HTML coverage reports and test results
5. **🎯 Coverage Badges** - Display coverage percentage in your README

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable Codecov (Recommended)

1. Go to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io) and sign in with GitHub
2. Add your repository to Codecov
3. Copy the upload token (if private repo)
4. Add the token as a GitHub secret: `CODECOV_TOKEN`

### 2. Add Coverage Badge to README

Add this to your `README.md`:

```markdown
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/TarCode/paylens-fastapi/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO)
[![Tests](https://github.com/TarCode/paylens-fastapi/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions/workflows/test.yml)
```

### 3. Configure Branch Protection (Optional)

In GitHub Settings → Branches → Add rule:
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date
- ✅ Select "Test Results" and "codecov/project"

## 📋 What You Get

### 1. **Pull Request Comments**
Every PR will show:
```
Coverage Report
📊 Coverage: 87.5% (+2.3%)
📈 Files changed: 5
🟢 Fully covered: 3 files
🟡 Partially covered: 2 files
🔴 Not covered: 0 files
```

### 2. **GitHub Actions Summary**
- ✅ Test Results: 37 passed, 0 failed
- 📊 Coverage: 87.5%
- 📁 Downloadable HTML coverage report

### 3. **Codecov Dashboard**
- 📈 Coverage trends over time
- 📊 File-by-file coverage breakdown
- 🎯 Coverage goals and targets
- 📋 Pull request impact analysis

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Run Tests with Coverage
```bash
# Full coverage report
make coverage

# Just the coverage percentage
make coverage-report

# Generate HTML report only
make coverage-html

# Generate XML report for CI
make coverage-xml
```

### View HTML Coverage Report
```bash
make coverage
open htmlcov/index.html  # macOS
# or
python -m http.server 8000 -d htmlcov  # Any OS
```

## 📊 Coverage Configuration

The `.coveragerc` file controls:
- **Source directories** to include
- **Files to omit** (tests, migrations, etc.)
- **Lines to exclude** (pragma: no cover, etc.)
- **Output formats** (HTML, XML)

## 🎯 Coverage Targets

Current targets:
- 🟢 **Green**: ≥80% coverage
- 🟡 **Orange**: 70-79% coverage  
- 🔴 **Red**: <70% coverage

## 📁 Generated Files

After running tests with coverage:
```
htmlcov/           # HTML coverage report
coverage.xml       # XML coverage report (for CI)
pytest.xml         # JUnit test results
.coverage          # Coverage database
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Coverage Not Showing?
1. Check `.coveragerc` source paths
2. Ensure tests are in `tests/` directory
3. Verify GitHub Actions workflow runs `coverage run`

### Codecov Upload Failing?
1. Check if repository is added to Codecov
2. Verify `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret (for private repos)
3. Ensure `coverage.xml` is generated

### PR Comments Not Working?
1. Verify GitHub token permissions
2. Check if workflow has `pull_request` trigger
3. Ensure `python-coverage-comment-action` step runs

## 📚 Advanced Features

### Custom Coverage Thresholds
Add to `.coveragerc`:
```ini
[report]
fail_under = 80
show_missing = true
skip_covered = false
```

### Exclude Specific Lines
```python
def debug_function():  # pragma: no cover
    print("Debug info")
```

### Multiple Coverage Formats
```bash
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report          # Terminal output
coverage html           # HTML report
coverage xml            # XML for CI tools
coverage json           # JSON format
```
